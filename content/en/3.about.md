Intro

#intro
Cybersecurity professional based in Paris, France

With over 3 years of experience in the field, I specialize in vulnerability management, threat intelligence, and security automation. My expertise lies in detecting, tracking, and remediating vulnerabilities and incidents for large organizations.

I have a strong background in configuring and optimizing security tools, improving operational efficiency through automation, and reporting key performance indicators. My skills in ethical hacking and development complement my cybersecurity focus.

Even when I'm not working, I'm always looking to expand my knowledge and skills in the rapidly evolving field of cybersecurity. I continue to develop my expertise through personal projects, participating in hacking challenges, and staying updated with the latest security trends.
